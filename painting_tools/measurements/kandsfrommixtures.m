% Purpose		Given the reflectance spectra of various mixtures of paints, at different
%				concentrations, use [Centore2013] to estimate the Kubelka-Munk coefficients,
%				K and S, for the two paints.
%
% Description	This routine is intended to find the Kubelka-Munk coefficients for a set of
%				constituent paints or colorants.  The constituent paints have been mixed in
%				various concentrations, and their reflectance spectra have been measured
%				with a spectrophotometer.  The variable Wavelengths records the set of 
%				wavelengths (in nm) at which the mixtures have been measured.  The input 
%				Reflectances records the reflectances measured at those wavelengths.  Reflectances
%				has one row for each mixture of colorants.
%
%				In 1987 [Walowit1987], Walowit, McCarthy, and Berns suggested a least squares
%				algorithm that simultaneously solves for K and S for each constituent colorant,
%				when given the reflectance spectra of mixtures of those colorants, at known
%				concentrations.  This routine uses an updated version ([Centore2013]) of their
%				algorithm.  The update involves assigning statistical weights to the linear
%				relationships in the least squares formulation.  A weight is conveniently expressed 
%				in terms of the standard deviation, or sigma, of the residual of a linear
%				relationship.  The algorithm actually applies to only one wavelength at a
%				time, so it is applied multiple times, once to each of the entries in Wavelengths.
%
%				Many of the variable names in this routine follow the names used in [Walowit1987].

%				Wavelengths		A row vector whose entries are the wavelengths for the reflectance

%
%				Reflectances	A matrix, whose rows are the reflectances (expressed as values

%
%				Concentrations	An n-column vector with the same number of rows as the input Reflectances.  
%								The first column gives the concentrations of the first paint (in the
